**Headline:** From Market Noise to AI-Powered Clarity: My Journey Building Market Genius

**Body:**

The financial markets are a sea of informationâ€”news, charts, and endless opinions. As a developer and tech enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by this complexity but also frustrated by the noise. How can you find clear, data-driven signals in the chaos?

That question led me down a rabbit hole of AI and finance, which ultimately inspired me to build **Market Genius**.

I wanted to create a tool that wasn't just another chart, but an intelligent partner. So, I built Market Genius using Next.js and Google's powerful Genkit AI framework. It analyzes real-time market data, news sentiment, and price action to generate simple, actionable trading signals: **Buy, Sell, or Hold.**

**Key Features:**
ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time AI Signals:** For both stocks and cryptocurrencies.
ðŸ”¹ **In-Depth Context:** Each signal comes with an AI-generated summary, explaining the 'why' behind the recommendation.
ðŸ”¹ **Live Push Notifications:** Get alerts directly on your phone so you never miss a potential opportunity.

This project was a personal challenge to harness the power of generative AI for a practical, real-world problem. I'm incredibly proud of how it turned out and excited to share it with the community.
